**  Android Pull to Refresh ListView

/**
 * A generic Android ListView implementation that has 'Pull to Refresh' functionality.
 * 
 * This ListView can be used in place of the normal Android android.widget.ListView class.
 * 
 * Users of this class should implement OnRefreshListener and call setOnRefreshListener(..)
 * to get notified on refresh events. The using class should call onRefreshComplete() when
 * refreshing is finished.
 * 
 * The using class can call setRefreshing() to set the state explicitly to refreshing. This 
 * is useful when you want to show the spinner and 'Refreshing' text when the
 * refresh was not triggered by 'Pull to Refresh', for example on start.
